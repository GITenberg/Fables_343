ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON</p>
<h2>I.&mdash;THE PERSONS OF THE TALE.</h2>
<p>After the 32nd chapter of <i>Treasure Island</i>, two of the 
puppets strolled out to have a pipe before business should begin 
again, and met in an open place not far from the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; said the first, with 
a man-o&rsquo;-war salute, and a beaming countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Silver!&rdquo; grunted the other.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in a bad way, Silver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Cap&rsquo;n Smollett,&rdquo; remonstrated Silver, 
&ldquo;dooty is dooty, as I knows, and none better; but 
we&rsquo;re off dooty now; and I can&rsquo;t see no call to keep 
up the morality business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a damned rogue, my man,&rdquo; said the 
Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Cap&rsquo;n, be just,&rdquo; returned the 
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no call to be angry with me in 
earnest.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m on&rsquo;y a chara&rsquo;ter in a sea 
story.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t really exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t really exist either,&rdquo; says 
the Captain, &ldquo;which seems to meet that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t set no limits to what a virtuous 
chara&rsquo;ter might consider argument,&rdquo; responded 
Silver.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m the villain of this tale, I 
am; and speaking as one sea-faring man to another, what I want to
know is, what&rsquo;s the odds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you never taught your catechism?&rdquo; said the 
Captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know there&rsquo;s such a 
thing as an Author?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a thing as a Author?&rdquo; returned John, 
derisively.&nbsp; &ldquo;And who better&rsquo;n me?&nbsp; And the
p&rsquo;int is, if the Author made you, he made Long John, and he
made Hands, and Pew, and George Merry&mdash;not that George is up
to much, for he&rsquo;s little more&rsquo;n a name; and he made 
Flint, what there is of him; and he made this here mutiny, you 
keep such a work about; and he had Tom Redruth shot; 
and&mdash;well, if that&rsquo;s a Author, give me Pew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe in a future state?&rdquo; said 
Smollett.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think there&rsquo;s nothing but the
present story-paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know for that,&rdquo; said 
Silver; &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t see what it&rsquo;s got to do 
with it, anyway.&nbsp; What I know is this: if there is sich a 
thing as a Author, I&rsquo;m his favourite chara&rsquo;ter.&nbsp;
He does me fathoms better&rsquo;n he does you&mdash;fathoms, he 
does.&nbsp; And he likes doing me.&nbsp; He keeps me on deck 
mostly all the time, crutch and all; and he leaves you measling 
in the hold, where nobody can&rsquo;t see you, nor wants to, and 
you may lay to that!&nbsp; If there is a Author, by thunder, but 
he&rsquo;s on my side, and you may lay to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see he&rsquo;s giving you a long rope,&rdquo; said 
the Captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;But that can&rsquo;t change a 
man&rsquo;s convictions.&nbsp; I know the Author respects me; I 
feel it in my bones; when you and I had that talk at the 
blockhouse door, who do you think he was for, my man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t he respect me?&rdquo; cried 
Silver.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, you should &lsquo;a&rsquo; heard me 
putting down my mutiny, George Merry and Morgan and that lot, no 
longer ago&rsquo;n last chapter; you&rsquo;d heard something 
then!&nbsp; You&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; seen what the Author 
thinks o&rsquo; me!&nbsp; But come now, do you consider yourself 
a virtuous chara&rsquo;ter clean through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; said Captain Smollett, 
solemnly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a man that tries to do his duty, and 
makes a mess of it as often as not.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a very 
popular man at home, Silver, I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo; and the 
Captain sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; says Silver.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then how about 
this sequel of yours?&nbsp; Are you to be Cap&rsquo;n Smollett 
just the same as ever, and not very popular at home, says 
you?&nbsp; And if so, why, it&rsquo;s <i>Treasure Island</i> over
again, by thunder; and I&rsquo;ll be Long John, and Pew&rsquo;ll 
be Pew, and we&rsquo;ll have another mutiny, as like as 
not.&nbsp; Or are you to be somebody else?&nbsp; And if so, why, 
what the better are you? and what the worse am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, look here, my man,&rdquo; returned the Captain, 
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand how this story comes about at 
all, can I?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t see how you and I, who 
don&rsquo;t exist, should get to speaking here, and smoke our 
pipes for all the world like reality?&nbsp; Very well, then, who 
am I to pipe up with my opinions?&nbsp; I know the Author&rsquo;s
on the side of good; he tells me so, it runs out of his pen as he
writes.&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s all I need to know; I&rsquo;ll 
take my chance upon the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact he seemed to be against George 
Merry,&rdquo; Silver admitted, musingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But George 
is little more&rsquo;n a name at the best of it,&rdquo; he added,
brightening.&nbsp; &ldquo;And to get into soundings for 
once.&nbsp; What is this good?&nbsp; I made a mutiny, and I been 
a gentleman o&rsquo; fortune; well, but by all stories, you 
ain&rsquo;t no such saint.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a man that keeps 
company very easy; even by your own account, you ain&rsquo;t, and
to my certain knowledge you&rsquo;re a devil to haze.&nbsp; Which
is which?&nbsp; Which is good, and which bad?&nbsp; Ah, you tell 
me that!&nbsp; Here we are in stays, and you may lay to 
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re none of us perfect,&rdquo; replied the 
Captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact of religion, my 
man.&nbsp; All I can say is, I try to do my duty; and if you try 
to do yours, I can&rsquo;t compliment you on your 
success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you was the judge, was you?&rdquo; said Silver, 
derisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would be both judge and hangman for you, my man, and 
never turn a hair,&rdquo; returned the Captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;But 
I get beyond that: it mayn&rsquo;t be sound theology, but 
it&rsquo;s common sense, that what is good is useful too&mdash;or
there and thereabout, for I don&rsquo;t set up to be a 
thinker.&nbsp; Now, where would a story go to if there were no 
virtuous characters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you go to that,&rdquo; replied Silver, &ldquo;where 
would a story begin, if there wasn&rsquo;t no 
villains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s pretty much my thought,&rdquo; said 
Captain Smollett.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Author has to get a story; 
that&rsquo;s what he wants; and to get a story, and to have a man
like the doctor (say) given a proper chance, he has to put in men
like you and Hands.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s on the right side; and 
you mind your eye!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not through this story yet;
there&rsquo;s trouble coming for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you bet?&rdquo; asked John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much I care if there ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned the 
Captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad enough to be Alexander 
Smollett, bad as he is; and I thank my stars upon my knees that 
I&rsquo;m not Silver.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s the ink-bottle 
opening.&nbsp; To quarters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed the Author was just then beginning to write the 
words:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> XXXIII.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>II.&mdash;THE SINKING SHIP.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the first lieutenant, bursting into 
the Captain&rsquo;s cabin, &ldquo;the ship is going 
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Spoker,&rdquo; said the Captain; 
&ldquo;but that is no reason for going about half-shaved.&nbsp; 
Exercise your mind a moment, Mr. Spoker, and you will see that to
the philosophic eye there is nothing new in our position: the 
ship (if she is to go down at all) may be said to have been going
down since she was launched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is settling fast,&rdquo; said the first lieutenant,
as he returned from shaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fast, Mr. Spoker?&rdquo; asked the Captain.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The expression is a strange one, for time (if you will 
think of it) is only relative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the lieutenant, &ldquo;I think it is 
scarcely worth while to embark in such a discussion when we shall
all be in Davy Jones&rsquo;s Locker in ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By parity of reasoning,&rdquo; returned the Captain 
gently, &ldquo;it would never be worth while to begin any inquiry
of importance; the odds are always overwhelming that we must die 
before we shall have brought it to an end.&nbsp; You have not 
considered, Mr. Spoker, the situation of man,&rdquo; said the 
Captain, smiling, and shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am much more engaged in considering the position of 
the ship,&rdquo; said Mr. Spoker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoken like a good officer,&rdquo; replied the Captain,
laying his hand on the lieutenant&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>On deck they found the men had broken into the spirit-room, 
and were fast getting drunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My men,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;there is no 
sense in this.&nbsp; The ship is going down, you will tell me, in
ten minutes: well, and what then?&nbsp; To the philosophic eye, 
there is nothing new in our position.&nbsp; All our lives long, 
we may have been about to break a blood-vessel or to be struck by
lightning, not merely in ten minutes, but in ten seconds; and 
that has not prevented us from eating dinner, no, nor from 
putting money in the Savings Bank.&nbsp; I assure you, with my 
hand on my heart, I fail to comprehend your attitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men were already too far gone to pay much heed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very painful sight, Mr. Spoker,&rdquo; said 
the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet to the philosophic eye, or whatever it 
is,&rdquo; replied the first lieutenant, &ldquo;they may be said 
to have been getting drunk since they came aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know if you always follow my thought, Mr. 
Spoker,&rdquo; returned the Captain gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;But let 
us proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the powder magazine they found an old salt smoking his 
pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God,&rdquo; cried the Captain, &ldquo;what are you
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the old salt, apologetically, 
&ldquo;they told me as she were going down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose she were?&rdquo; said the Captain.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;To the philosophic eye, there would be nothing new in our 
position.&nbsp; Life, my old shipmate, life, at any moment and in
any view, is as dangerous as a sinking ship; and yet it is 
man&rsquo;s handsome fashion to carry umbrellas, to wear 
indiarubber over-shoes, to begin vast works, and to conduct 
himself in every way as if he might hope to be eternal.&nbsp; And
for my own poor part I should despise the man who, even on board 
a sinking ship, should omit to take a pill or to wind up his 
watch.&nbsp; That, my friend, would not be the human 
attitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Spoker.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;But what is precisely the difference between shaving in a 
sinking ship and smoking in a powder magazine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or doing anything at all in any conceivable 
circumstances?&rdquo; cried the Captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perfectly 
conclusive; give me a cigar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two minutes afterwards the ship blew up with a glorious 
detonation.</p>
<h2>III&mdash;THE TWO MATCHES.</h2>
<p>One day there was a traveller in the woods in California, in 
the dry season, when the Trades were blowing strong.&nbsp; He had
ridden a long way, and he was tired and hungry, and dismounted 
from his horse to smoke a pipe.&nbsp; But when he felt in his 
pocket he found but two matches.&nbsp; He struck the first, and 
it would not light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a pretty state of things!&rdquo; said the 
traveller.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dying for a smoke; only one match left; 
and that certain to miss fire!&nbsp; Was there ever a creature so
unfortunate?&nbsp; And yet,&rdquo; thought the traveller, 
&ldquo;suppose I light this match, and smoke my pipe, and shake 
out the dottle here in the grass&mdash;the grass might catch on 
fire, for it is dry like tinder; and while I snatch out the 
flames in front, they might evade and run behind me, and seize 
upon yon bush of poison oak; before I could reach it, that would 
have blazed up; over the bush I see a pine tree hung with moss; 
that too would fly in fire upon the instant to its topmost bough;
and the flame of that long torch&mdash;how would the trade wind 
take and brandish that through the inflammable forest!&nbsp; I 
hear this dell roar in a moment with the joint voice of wind and 
fire, I see myself gallop for my soul, and the flying 
conflagration chase and outflank me through the hills; I see this
pleasant forest burn for days, and the cattle roasted, and the 
springs dried up, and the farmer ruined, and his children cast 
upon the world.&nbsp; What a world hangs upon this 
moment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he struck the match, and it missed fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; said the traveller, and put his pipe 
in his pocket.</p>
<h2>IV.&mdash;THE SICK MAN AND THE FIREMAN.</h2>
<p>There was once a sick man in a burning house, to whom there 
entered a fireman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not save me,&rdquo; said the sick man.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Save those who are strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you kindly tell me why?&rdquo; inquired the 
fireman, for he was a civil fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could possibly be fairer,&rdquo; said the sick 
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;The strong should be preferred in all cases, 
because they are of more service in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fireman pondered a while, for he was a man of some 
philosophy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Granted,&rdquo; said he at last, as 
apart of the roof fell in; &ldquo;but for the sake of 
conversation, what would you lay down as the proper service of 
the strong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing can possibly be easier,&rdquo; returned the 
sick man; &ldquo;the proper service of the strong is to help the 
weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the fireman reflected, for there was nothing hasty about
this excellent creature.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could forgive you being 
sick,&rdquo; he said at last, as a portion of the wall fell out, 
&ldquo;but I cannot bear your being such a fool.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
with that he heaved up his fireman&rsquo;s axe, for he was 
eminently just, and clove the sick man to the bed.</p>
<h2>V.&mdash;THE DEVIL AND THE INNKEEPER.</h2>
<p>Once upon a time the devil stayed at an inn, where no one knew
him, for they were people whose education had been 
neglected.&nbsp; He was bent on mischief, and for a time kept 
everybody by the ears.&nbsp; But at last the innkeeper set a 
watch upon the devil and took him in the fact.</p>
<p>The innkeeper got a rope&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am going to thrash you,&rdquo; said the 
innkeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no right to be angry with me,&rdquo; said the 
devil.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am only the devil, and it is my nature to 
do wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; asked the innkeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact, I assure you,&rdquo; said the devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really cannot help doing ill?&rdquo; asked the 
innkeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the smallest,&rdquo; said the devil; &ldquo;it 
would be useless cruelty to thrash a thing like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would indeed,&rdquo; said the innkeeper.</p>
<p>And he made a noose and hanged the devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said the innkeeper.</p>
<h2>VI.&mdash;THE PENITENT</h2>
<p>A man met a lad weeping.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you weep 
for?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am weeping for my sins,&rdquo; said the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have little to do,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>The next day they met again.&nbsp; Once more the lad was 
weeping.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you weep now?&rdquo; asked the 
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am weeping because I have nothing to eat,&rdquo; said
the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it would come to that,&rdquo; said the 
man.</p>
<h2>VII.&mdash;THE YELLOW PAINT.</h2>
<p>In a certain city there lived a physician who sold yellow 
paint.&nbsp; This was of so singular a virtue that whoso was 
bedaubed with it from head to heel was set free from the dangers 
of life, and the bondage of sin, and the fear of death for 
ever.&nbsp; So the physician said in his prospectus; and so said 
all the citizens in the city; and there was nothing more urgent 
in men&rsquo;s hearts than to be properly painted themselves, and
nothing they took more delight in than to see others 
painted.&nbsp; There was in the same city a young man of a very 
good family but of a somewhat reckless life, who had reached the 
age of manhood, and would have nothing to say to the paint: 
&ldquo;To-morrow was soon enough,&rdquo; said he; and when the 
morrow came he would still put it off.&nbsp; She might have 
continued to do until his death; only, he had a friend of about 
his own age and much of his own manners; and this youth, taking a
walk in the public street, with not one fleck of paint upon his 
body, was suddenly run down by a water-cart and cut off in the 
heyday of his nakedness.&nbsp; This shook the other to the soul; 
so that I never beheld a man more earnest to be painted; and on 
the very same evening, in the presence of all his family, to 
appropriate music, and himself weeping aloud, he received three 
complete coats and a touch of varnish on the top.&nbsp; The 
physician (who was himself affected even to tears) protested he 
had never done a job so thorough.</p>
<p>Some two months afterwards, the young man was carried on a 
stretcher to the physician&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; he cried, as soon 
as the door was opened.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was to be set free from 
all the dangers of life; and here have I been run down by that 
self-same water-cart, and my leg is broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said the physician.&nbsp; &ldquo;This 
is very sad.&nbsp; But I perceive I must explain to you the 
action of my paint.&nbsp; A broken bone is a mighty small affair 
at the worst of it; and it belongs to a class of accident to 
which my paint is quite inapplicable.&nbsp; Sin, my dear young 
friend, sin is the sole calamity that a wise man should 
apprehend; it is against sin that I have fitted you out; and when
you come to be tempted, you will give me news of my 
paint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;I did not 
understand that, and it seems rather disappointing.&nbsp; But I 
have no doubt all is for the best; and in the meanwhile, I shall 
be obliged to you if you will set my leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is none of my business,&rdquo; said the physician;
&ldquo;but if your bearers will carry you round the corner to the
surgeon&rsquo;s, I feel sure he will afford relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some three years later, the young man came running to the 
physician&rsquo;s house in a great perturbation.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Here was I to be set free from the bondage of sin; and I 
have just committed forgery, arson and murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said the physician.&nbsp; &ldquo;This 
is very serious.&nbsp; Off with your clothes at 
once.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as soon as the young man had stripped, he 
examined him from head to foot.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he cried 
with great relief, &ldquo;there is not a flake broken.&nbsp; 
Cheer up, my young friend, your paint is as good as 
new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried the young man, &ldquo;and what 
then can be the use of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the physician, &ldquo;I perceive I 
must explain to you the nature of the action of my paint.&nbsp; 
It does not exactly prevent sin; it extenuates instead the 
painful consequences.&nbsp; It is not so much for this world, as 
for the next; it is not against life; in short, it is against 
death that I have fitted you out.&nbsp; And when you come to die,
you will give me news of my paint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried the young man, &ldquo;I had not 
understood that, and it seems a little disappointing.&nbsp; But 
there is no doubt all is for the best: and in the meanwhile, I 
shall be obliged if you will help me to undo the evil I have 
brought on innocent persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is none of my business,&rdquo; said the physician;
&ldquo;but if you will go round the corner to the police office, 
I feel sure it will afford you relief to give yourself 
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six weeks later, the physician was called to the town 
gaol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; cried the young 
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here am I literally crusted with your paint; 
and I have broken my leg, and committed all the crimes in the 
calendar, and must be hanged to-morrow; and am in the meanwhile 
in a fear so extreme that I lack words to picture it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said the physician.&nbsp; &ldquo;This 
is really amazing.&nbsp; Well, well; perhaps, if you had not been
painted, you would have been more frightened still.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>VIII.&mdash;THE HOUSE OF ELD.</h2>
<p>So soon as the child began to speak, the gyve was riveted; and
the boys and girls limped about their play like convicts.&nbsp; 
Doubtless it was more pitiable to see and more painful to bear in
youth; but even the grown folk, besides being very unhandy on 
their feet, were often sick with ulcers.</p>
<p>About the time when Jack was ten years old, many strangers 
began to journey through that country.&nbsp; These he beheld 
going lightly by on the long roads, and the thing amazed 
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder how it comes,&rdquo; he asked, 
&ldquo;that all these strangers are so quick afoot, and we must 
drag about our fetter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; said his uncle, the catechist, 
&ldquo;do not complain about your fetter, for it is the only 
thing that makes life worth living.&nbsp; None are happy, none 
are good, none are respectable, that are not gyved like us.&nbsp;
And I must tell you, besides, it is very dangerous talk.&nbsp; If
you grumble of your iron, you will have no luck; if ever you take
it off, you will be instantly smitten by a 
thunderbolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there no thunderbolts for these strangers?&rdquo; 
asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jupiter is longsuffering to the benighted,&rdquo; 
returned the catechist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, I could wish I had been less 
fortunate,&rdquo; said Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;For if I had been born 
benighted, I might now be going free; and it cannot be denied the
iron is inconvenient, and the ulcer hurts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried his uncle, &ldquo;do not envy the 
heathen!&nbsp; Theirs is a sad lot!&nbsp; Ah, poor souls, if they
but knew the joys of being fettered!&nbsp; Poor souls, my heart 
yearns for them.&nbsp; But the truth is they are vile, odious, 
insolent, ill-conditioned, stinking brutes, not truly 
human&mdash;for what is a man without a fetter?&mdash;and you 
cannot be too particular not to touch or speak with 
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this talk, the child would never pass one of the 
unfettered on the road but what he spat at him and called him 
names, which was the practice of the children in that part.</p>
<p>It chanced one day, when he was fifteen, he went into the 
woods, and the ulcer pained him.&nbsp; It was a fair day, with a 
blue sky; all the birds were singing; but Jack nursed his 
foot.&nbsp; Presently, another song began; it sounded like the 
singing of a person, only far more gay; at the same time there 
was a beating on the earth.&nbsp; Jack put aside the leaves; and 
there was a lad of his own village, leaping, and dancing and 
singing to himself in a green dell; and on the grass beside him 
lay the dancer&rsquo;s iron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Jack, &ldquo;you have your fetter 
off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t tell your 
uncle!&rdquo; cried the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you fear my uncle,&rdquo; returned Jack &ldquo;why 
do you not fear the thunderbolt&rdquo;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is only an old wives&rsquo; tale,&rdquo; said the 
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is only told to children.&nbsp; Scores of 
us come here among the woods and dance for nights together, and 
are none the worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This put Jack in a thousand new thoughts.&nbsp; He was a grave
lad; he had no mind to dance himself; he wore his fetter 
manfully, and tended his ulcer without complaint.&nbsp; But he 
loved the less to be deceived or to see others cheated.&nbsp; He 
began to lie in wait for heathen travellers, at covert parts of 
the road, and in the dusk of the day, so that he might speak with
them unseen; and these were greatly taken with their wayside 
questioner, and told him things of weight.&nbsp; The wearing of 
gyves (they said) was no command of Jupiter&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It was
the contrivance of a white-faced thing, a sorcerer, that dwelt in
that country in the Wood of Eld.&nbsp; He was one like Glaucus 
that could change his shape, yet he could be always told; for 
when he was crossed, he gobbled like a turkey.&nbsp; He had three
lives; but the third smiting would make an end of him indeed; and
with that his house of sorcery would vanish, the gyves fall, and 
the villagers take hands and dance like children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in your country?&rdquo; Jack would ask.</p>
<p>But at this the travellers, with one accord, would put him 
off; until Jack began to suppose there was no land entirely 
happy.&nbsp; Or, if there were, it must be one that kept its folk
at home; which was natural enough.</p>
<p>But the case of the gyves weighed upon him.&nbsp; The sight of
the children limping stuck in his eyes; the groans of such as 
dressed their ulcers haunted him.&nbsp; And it came at last in 
his mind that he was born to free them.</p>
<p>There was in that village a sword of heavenly forgery, beaten 
upon Vulcan&rsquo;s anvil.&nbsp; It was never used but in the 
temple, and then the flat of it only; and it hung on a nail by 
the catechist&rsquo;s chimney.&nbsp; Early one night, Jack rose, 
and took the sword, and was gone out of the house and the village
in the darkness.</p>
<p>All night he walked at a venture; and when day came, he met 
strangers going to the fields.&nbsp; Then he asked after the Wood
of Eld and the house of sorcery; and one said north, and one 
south; until Jack saw that they deceived him.&nbsp; So then, when
he asked his way of any man, he showed the bright sword naked; 
and at that the gyve on the man&rsquo;s ankle rang, and answered 
in his stead; and the word was still <i>Straight on</i>.&nbsp; 
But the man, when his gyve spoke, spat and struck at Jack, and 
threw stones at him as he went away; so that his head was 
broken.</p>
<p>So he came to that wood, and entered in, and he was aware of a
house in a low place, where funguses grew, and the trees met, and
the steaming of the marsh arose about it like a smoke.&nbsp; It 
was a fine house, and a very rambling; some parts of it were 
ancient like the hills, and some but of yesterday, and none 
finished; and all the ends of it were open, so that you could go 
in from every side.&nbsp; Yet it was in good repair, and all the 
chimneys smoked.</p>
<p>Jack went in through the gable; and there was one room after 
another, all bare, but all furnished in part, so that a man could
dwell there; and in each there was a fire burning, where a man 
could warm himself, and a table spread where he might eat.&nbsp; 
But Jack saw nowhere any living creature; only the bodies of some
stuffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a hospitable house,&rdquo; said Jack; 
&ldquo;but the ground must be quaggy underneath, for at every 
step the building quakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had gone some time in the house, when he began to be 
hungry.&nbsp; Then he looked at the food, and at first he was 
afraid; but he bared the sword, and by the shining of the sword, 
it seemed the food was honest.&nbsp; So he took the courage to 
sit down and eat, and he was refreshed in mind and body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is strange,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;that in the 
house of sorcery there should be food so wholesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was yet eating, there came into that room the appearance
of his uncle, and Jack was afraid because he had taken the 
sword.&nbsp; But his uncle was never more kind, and sat down to 
meat with him, and praised him because he had taken the 
sword.&nbsp; Never had these two been more pleasantly together, 
and Jack was full of love to the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very well done,&rdquo; said his uncle, &ldquo;to
take the sword and come yourself into the House of Eld; a good 
thought and a brave deed.&nbsp; But now you are satisfied; and we
may go home to dinner arm in arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no!&rdquo; said Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not 
satisfied yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; cried his uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you not 
warmed by the fire?&nbsp; Does not this food sustain 
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see the food to be wholesome,&rdquo; said Jack; 
&ldquo;and still it is no proof that a man should wear a gyve on 
his right leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now at this the appearance of his uncle gobbled like a 
turkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jupiter!&rdquo; cried Jack, &ldquo;is this the 
sorcerer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hand held back and his heart failed him for the love he 
bore his uncle; but he heaved up the sword and smote the 
appearance on the head; and it cried out aloud with the voice of 
his uncle; and fell to the ground; and a little bloodless white 
thing fled from the room.</p>
<p>The cry rang in Jack&rsquo;s ears, and his knees smote 
together, and conscience cried upon him; and yet he was 
strengthened, and there woke in his bones the lust of that 
enchanter&rsquo;s blood.&nbsp; &ldquo;If the gyves are to 
fall,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I must go through with this, and 
when I get home I shall find my uncle dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he went on after the bloodless thing.&nbsp; In the way, he 
met the appearance of his father; and his father was incensed, 
and railed upon him, and called to him upon his duty, and bade 
him be home, while there was yet time.&nbsp; &ldquo;For you can 
still,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;be home by sunset; and then all 
will be forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;I fear your anger; 
but yet your anger does not prove that a man should wear a gyve 
on his right leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at that the appearance of his father gobbled like a 
turkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, heaven,&rdquo; cried Jack, &ldquo;the sorcerer 
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blood ran backward in his body and his joints rebelled 
against him for the love he bore his father; but he heaved up the
sword, and plunged it in the heart of the appearance; and the 
appearance cried out aloud with the voice of his father; and fell
to the ground; and a little bloodless white thing fled from the 
room.</p>
<p>The cry rang in Jack&rsquo;s ears, and his soul was darkened; 
but now rage came to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have done what I dare 
not think upon,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will go to an end 
with it, or perish.&nbsp; And when I get home, I pray God this 
may be a dream, and I may find my father dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he went on after the bloodless thing that had escaped; and 
in the way he met the appearance of his mother, and she 
wept.&nbsp; &ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What is this that you have done?&nbsp; Oh, come home 
(where you may be by bedtime) ere you do more ill to me and mine;
for it is enough to smite my brother and your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear mother, it is not these that I have 
smitten,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;it was but the enchanter in 
their shape.&nbsp; And even if I had, it would not prove that a 
man should wear a gyve on his right leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at this the appearance gobbled like a turkey.</p>
<p>He never knew how he did that; but he swung the sword on the 
one side, and clove the appearance through the midst; and it 
cried out aloud with the voice of his mother; and fell to the 
ground; and with the fall of it, the house was gone from over 
Jack&rsquo;s head, and he stood alone in the woods, and the gyve 
was loosened from his leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the enchanter is now dead,
and the fetter gone.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the cries rang in his soul,
and the day was like night to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;This has been a 
sore business,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me get forth out 
of the wood, and see the good that I have done to 
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought to leave the fetter where it lay, but when he 
turned to go, his mind was otherwise.&nbsp; So he stooped and put
the gyve in his bosom; and the rough iron galled him as he went, 
and his bosom bled.</p>
<p>Now when he was forth of the wood upon the highway, he met 
folk returning from the field; and those he met had no fetter on 
the right leg, but, behold! they had one upon the left.&nbsp; 
Jack asked them what it signified; and they said, &ldquo;that was
the new wear, for the old was found to be a 
superstition&rdquo;.&nbsp; Then he looked at them nearly; and 
there was a new ulcer on the left ankle, and the old one on the 
right was not yet healed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, may God forgive me!&rdquo; cried Jack.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I would I were well home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when he was home, there lay his uncle smitten on the head,
and his father pierced through the heart, and his mother cloven 
through the midst.&nbsp; And he sat in the lone house and wept 
beside the bodies.</p>
<h3>MORAL.</h3>
<p>Old is the tree and the fruit good,<br />
Very old and thick the wood.<br />

<h2>IX.&mdash;THE FOUR REFORMERS.</h2>
<p>Four reformers met under a bramble bush.&nbsp; They were all 
agreed the world must be changed.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must abolish 
property,&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must abolish marriage,&rdquo; said the second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must abolish God,&rdquo; said the third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could abolish work,&rdquo; said the 
fourth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not let us get beyond practical politics,&rdquo; 
said the first.&nbsp; &ldquo;The first thing is to reduce men to 
a common level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing,&rdquo; said the second, &ldquo;is to 
give freedom to the sexes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing,&rdquo; said the third, &ldquo;is to 
find out how to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first step,&rdquo; said the first, &ldquo;is to 
abolish the Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing,&rdquo; said the second, &ldquo;is to 
abolish the laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing,&rdquo; said the third, &ldquo;is to 
abolish mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>X.&mdash;THE MAN AND HIS FRIEND.</h2>
<p>A man quarrelled with his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been much deceived in you,&rdquo; said the 
man.</p>
<p>And the friend made a face at him and went away.</p>
<p>A little after, they both died, and came together before the 
great white Justice of the Peace.&nbsp; It began to look black 
for the friend, but the man for a while had a clear character and
was getting in good spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find here some record of a quarrel,&rdquo; said the 
justice, looking in his notes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Which of you was in 
the wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was,&rdquo; said the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;He spoke ill 
of me behind my back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he so?&rdquo; said the justice.&nbsp; &ldquo;And 
pray how did he speak about your neighbours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he had always a nasty tongue,&rdquo; said the 
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you chose him for your friend?&rdquo; cried the 
justice.&nbsp; &ldquo;My good fellow, we have no use here for 
fools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the man was cast in the pit, and the friend laughed out 
aloud in the dark and remained to be tried on other charges.</p>
<h2>XI.&mdash;THE READER.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I never read such an impious book,&rdquo; said the 
reader, throwing it on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not hurt me,&rdquo; said the book; &ldquo;you 
will only get less for me second hand, and I did not write 
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the reader.&nbsp; &ldquo;My 
quarrel is with your author.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said the book, &ldquo;you need not buy
his rant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the reader.&nbsp; &ldquo;But 
I thought him such a cheerful writer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find him so,&rdquo; said the book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be differently made from me,&rdquo; said the 
reader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you a fable,&rdquo; said the book.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;There were two men wrecked upon a desert island; one of 
them made believe he was at home, the other 
admitted&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know your kind of fable,&rdquo; said the 
reader.&nbsp; &ldquo;They both died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so they did,&rdquo; said the book.&nbsp; &ldquo;No 
doubt of that.&nbsp; And everybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the reader.&nbsp; &ldquo;Push
it a little further for this once.&nbsp; And when they were all 
dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were in God&rsquo;s hands, the same as 
before,&rdquo; said the book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much to boast of, by your account,&rdquo; cried the
reader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is impious now?&rdquo; said the book.</p>
<p>And the reader put him on the fire.</p>
<blockquote><p>The coward crouches from the rod,<br />
And loathes the iron face of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>XII.&mdash;THE CITIZEN AND THE TRAVELLER.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Look round you,&rdquo; said the citizen.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;This is the largest market in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, surely not,&rdquo; said the traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps not the largest,&rdquo; said the citizen,
&ldquo;but much the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are certainly wrong there,&rdquo; said the 
traveller.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can tell you . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>They buried the stranger at the dusk.</p>
<h2>XIII.&mdash;THE DISTINGUISHED STRANGER.</h2>
<p>Once upon a time there came to this earth a visitor from a 
neighbouring planet.&nbsp; And he was met at the place of his 
descent by a great philosopher, who was to show him 
everything.</p>
<p>First of all they came through a wood, and the stranger looked
upon the trees.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whom have we here?&rdquo; said 
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are only vegetables,&rdquo; said the 
philosopher.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are alive, but not at all 
interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said the 
stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;They seem to have very good manners.&nbsp;
Do they never speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They lack the gift,&rdquo; said the philosopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet I think I hear them sing,&rdquo; said the 
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is only the wind among the leaves,&rdquo; said the
philosopher.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will explain to you the theory of 
winds: it is very interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;I wish I knew 
what they are thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cannot think,&rdquo; said the philosopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; returned the 
stranger: and then, laying his hand upon a trunk: &ldquo;I like 
these people,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not people at all,&rdquo; said the 
philosopher.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next they came through a meadow where there were cows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are very dirty people,&rdquo; said the 
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not people at all,&rdquo; said the 
philosopher; and he explained what a cow is in scientific words 
which I have forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all one to me,&rdquo; said the stranger.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;But why do they never look up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they are graminivorous,&rdquo; said the 
philosopher; &ldquo;and to live upon grass, which is not highly 
nutritious, requires so close an attention to business that they 
have no time to think, or speak, or look at the scenery, or keep 
themselves clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;that is one way 
to live, no doubt.&nbsp; But I prefer the people with the green 
heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next they came into a city, and the streets were full of men 
and women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are very odd people,&rdquo; said the 
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are the people of the greatest nation in the 
world,&rdquo; said the philosopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they indeed?&rdquo; said the stranger.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;They scarcely look so.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>XIV.&mdash;THE CART-HORSES AND THE SADDLE-HORSE.</h2>
<p>Two cart-horses, a gelding and a mare, were brought to Samoa, 
and put in the same field with a saddle-horse to run free on the 
island.&nbsp; They were rather afraid to go near him, for they 
saw he was a saddle-horse, and supposed he would not speak to 
them.&nbsp; Now the saddle-horse had never seen creatures so 
big.&nbsp; &ldquo;These must be great chiefs,&rdquo; thought he, 
and he approached them civilly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady and 
gentleman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I understand you are from the 
colonies.&nbsp; I offer you my affectionate compliments, and make
you heartily welcome to the islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonials looked at him askance, and consulted with each 
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can he be?&rdquo; said the gelding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems suspiciously civil,&rdquo; said the mare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think he can be much account,&rdquo; said the 
gelding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it he is only a Kanaka,&rdquo; said the 
mare.</p>
<p>Then they turned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the devil!&rdquo; said the gelding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder at your impudence, speaking to persons of our 
quality!&rdquo; cried the mare.</p>
<p>The saddle-horse went away by himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was 
right,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they are great chiefs.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>XV.&mdash;THE TADPOLE AND THE FROG.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Be ashamed of yourself,&rdquo; said the frog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a tadpole, I had no tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I thought!&rdquo; said the tadpole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never were a tadpole.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>XVI.&mdash;SOMETHING IN IT.</h2>
<p>The natives told him many tales.&nbsp; In particular, they 
warned him of the house of yellow reeds tied with black sinnet, 
how any one who touched it became instantly the prey of 
Aka&auml;nga, and was handed on to him by Miru the ruddy, and 
hocussed with the kava of the dead, and baked in the ovens and 
eaten by the eaters of the dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing in it,&rdquo; said the missionary.</p>
<p>There was a bay upon that island, a very fair bay to look 
upon; but, by the native saying, it was death to bathe 
there.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is nothing in that,&rdquo; said the 
missionary; and he came to the bay, and went swimming.&nbsp; 
Presently an eddy took him and bore him towards the reef.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; thought the missionary, &ldquo;it seems there 
is something in it after all.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he swam the 
harder, but the eddy carried him away.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not care
about this eddy,&rdquo; said the missionary; and even as he said 
it, he was aware of a house raised on piles above the sea; it was
built of yellow reeds, one reed joined with another, and the 
whole bound with black sinnet; a ladder led to the door, and all 
about the house hung calabashes.&nbsp; He had never seen such a 
house, nor yet such calabashes; and the eddy set for the 
ladder.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is singular,&rdquo; said the 
missionary, &ldquo;but there can be nothing in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
And he laid hold of the ladder and went up.&nbsp; It was a fine 
house; but there was no man there; and when the missionary looked
back he saw no island, only the heaving of the sea.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It is strange about the island,&rdquo; said the 
missionary, &ldquo;but who&rsquo;s afraid? my stories are the 
true ones.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he laid hold of a calabash, for he 
was one that loved curiosities.&nbsp; Now he had no sooner laid 
hand upon the calabash than that which he handled, and that which
he saw and stood on, burst like a bubble and was gone; and night 
closed upon him, and the waters, and the meshes of the net; and 
he wallowed there like a fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A body would think there was something in this,&rdquo; 
said the missionary.&nbsp; &ldquo;But if these tales are true, I 
wonder what about my tales!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the flaming of Aka&auml;nga&rsquo;s torch drew near in the
night; and the misshapen hands groped in the meshes of the net; 
and they took the missionary between the finger and the thumb, 
and bore him dripping in the night and silence to the place of 
the ovens of Miru.&nbsp; And there was Miru, ruddy in the glow of
the ovens; and there sat her four daughters, and made the kava of
the dead; and there sat the comers out of the islands of the 
living, dripping and lamenting.</p>
<p>This was a dread place to reach for any of the sons of 
men.&nbsp; But of all who ever came there, the missionary was the
most concerned; and, to make things worse, the person next him 
was a convert of his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; said the convert, &ldquo;so you are here 
like your neighbours?&nbsp; And how about all your 
stories?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; said the missionary, with bursting 
tears, &ldquo;that there was nothing in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this the kava of the dead was ready, and the daughters of 
Miru began to intone in the old manner of singing.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Gone are the green islands and the bright sea, the sun and
the moon and the forty million stars, and life and love and 
hope.&nbsp; Henceforth is no more, only to sit in the night and 
silence, and see your friends devoured; for life is a deceit, and
the bandage is taken from your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now when the singing was done, one of the daughters came with 
the bowl.&nbsp; Desire of that kava rose in the 
missionary&rsquo;s bosom; he lusted for it like a swimmer for the
land, or a bridegroom for his bride; and he reached out his hand,
and took the bowl, and would have drunk.&nbsp; And then he 
remembered, and put it back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink!&rdquo; sang the daughter of Miru.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no kava like the kava of the dead, and to 
drink of it once is the reward of living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you.&nbsp; It smells excellent,&rdquo; said the
missionary.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I am a blue-ribbon man myself; and 
though I am aware there is a difference of opinion even in our 
own confession, I have always held kava to be 
excluded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the convert.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you 
going to respect a taboo at a time like this?&nbsp; And you were 
always so opposed to taboos when you were alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To other people&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the 
missionary.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never to my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yours have all proved wrong,&rdquo; said the 
convert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like it,&rdquo; said the missionary, 
&ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t help that.&nbsp; No reason why I should 
break my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard the like of this!&rdquo; cried the 
daughter of Miru.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, what do you expect to 
gain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not the point,&rdquo; said the 
missionary.&nbsp; &ldquo;I took this pledge for others, I am not 
going to break it for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The daughter of Miru was puzzled; she came and told her 
mother, and Miru was vexed; and they went and told 
Aka&auml;nga.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do about 
this,&rdquo; said Aka&auml;nga; and he came and reasoned with the
missionary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there <i>is</i> such a thing as right and 
wrong,&rdquo; said the missionary; &ldquo;and your ovens cannot 
alter that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give the kava to the rest,&rdquo; said Aka&auml;nga to 
the daughters of Miru.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must get rid of this 
sea-lawyer instantly, or worse will come of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment the missionary came up in the midst of the 
sea, and there before him were the palm trees of the 
island.&nbsp; He swam to the shore gladly, and landed.&nbsp; Much
matter of thought was in that missionary&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seem to have been misinformed upon some 
points,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps there is not much in
it, as I supposed; but there is something in it after all.&nbsp; 
Let me be glad of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he rang the bell for service.</p>
<h3>MORAL.</h3>
<p>The sticks break, the stones crumble,<br />
The eternal altars tilt and tumble,<br />
Sanctions and tales dislimn like mist<br />
About the amazed evangelist.<br />
He stands unshook from age to youth<br />
Upon one pin-point of the truth.</p>
<h2>XVII.&mdash;FAITH, HALF FAITH AND NO FAITH AT ALL.</h2>
<p>In the ancient days there went three men upon pilgrimage; one 
was a priest, and one was a virtuous person, and the third was an
old rover with his axe.</p>
<p>As they went, the priest spoke about the grounds of faith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We find the proofs of our religion in the works of 
nature,&rdquo; said he, and beat his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the virtuous person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The peacock has a scrannel voice,&rdquo; said the 
priest, &ldquo;as has been laid down always in our books.&nbsp; 
How cheering!&rdquo; he cried, in a voice like one that 
wept.&nbsp; &ldquo;How comforting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I require no such proofs,&rdquo; said the virtuous 
person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have no reasonable faith,&rdquo; said the 
priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great is the right, and shall prevail!&rdquo; cried the
virtuous person.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is loyalty in my soul; be 
sure, there is loyalty in the mind of Odin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are but playings upon words,&rdquo; returned the 
priest.&nbsp; &ldquo;A sackful of such trash is nothing to the 
peacock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then they passed a country farm, where there was a 
peacock seated on a rail; and the bird opened its mouth and sang 
with the voice of a nightingale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you now?&rdquo; asked the virtuous 
person.&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet this shakes not me!&nbsp; Great is 
the truth, and shall prevail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil fly away with that peacock!&rdquo; said the 
priest; and he was downcast for a mile or two.</p>
<p>But presently they came to a shrine, where a Fakeer performed 
miracles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;here are the true 
grounds of faith.&nbsp; The peacock was but an adminicle.&nbsp; 
This is the base of our religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he beat upon his breast, and groaned like one with 
colic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to me,&rdquo; said the virtuous person, &ldquo;all 
this is as little to the purpose as the peacock.&nbsp; I believe 
because I see the right is great and must prevail; and this 
Fakeer might carry on with his conjuring tricks till doomsday, 
and it would not play bluff upon a man like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now at this the Fakeer was so much incensed that his hand 
trembled; and, lo! in the midst of a miracle the cards fell from 
up his sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you now?&rdquo; asked the virtuous 
person.&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet it shakes not me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil fly away with the Fakeer!&rdquo; cried the 
priest.&nbsp; &ldquo;I really do not see the good of going on 
with this pilgrimage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up!&rdquo; cried the virtuous person.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Great is the right, and shall prevail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are quite sure it will prevail,&rdquo; says the 
priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pledge my word for that,&rdquo; said the virtuous 
person.</p>
<p>So the other began to go on again with a better heart.</p>
<p>At last one came running, and told them all was lost: that the
powers of darkness had besieged the Heavenly Mansions, that Odin 
was to die, and evil triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been grossly deceived,&rdquo; cried the virtuous
person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is lost now,&rdquo; said the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it is too late to make it up with the 
devil?&rdquo; said the virtuous person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope not,&rdquo; said the priest.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;And at any rate we can but try.&nbsp; But what are you 
doing with your axe?&rdquo; says he to the rover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am off to die with Odin,&rdquo; said the rover.</p>
<h2>XVIII.&mdash;THE TOUCHSTONE.</h2>
<p>The King was a man that stood well before the world; his smile
was sweet as clover, but his soul withinsides was as little as a 
pea.&nbsp; He had two sons; and the younger son was a boy after 
his heart, but the elder was one whom he feared.&nbsp; It befell 
one morning that the drum sounded in the dun before it was yet 
day; and the King rode with his two sons, and a brave array 
behind them.&nbsp; They rode two hours, and came to the foot of a
brown mountain that was very steep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do we ride?&rdquo; said the elder son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Across this brown mountain,&rdquo; said the King, and 
smiled to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father knows what he is doing,&rdquo; said the 
younger son.</p>
<p>And they rode two hours more, and came to the sides of a black
river that was wondrous deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where do we ride?&rdquo; asked the elder son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over this black river,&rdquo; said the King, and smiled
to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father knows what he is doing,&rdquo; said the 
younger son.</p>
<p>And they rode all that day, and about the time of the 
sunsetting came to the side of a lake, where was a great dun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is here we ride,&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;to a 
King&rsquo;s house, and a priest&rsquo;s, and a house where you 
will learn much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the gates of the dun, the King who was a priest met them; 
and he was a grave man, and beside him stood his daughter, and 
she was as fair as the morn, and one that smiled and looked 
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are my two sons,&rdquo; said the first King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here is my daughter,&rdquo; said the King who was a
priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a wonderful fine maid,&rdquo; said the first 
King, &ldquo;and I like her manner of smiling,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are wonderful well-grown lads,&rdquo; said the 
second, &ldquo;and I like their gravity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the two Kings looked at each other, and said, 
&ldquo;The thing may come about&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile the two lads looked upon the maid, and 
the one grew pale and the other red; and the maid looked upon the
ground smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the maid that I shall marry,&rdquo; said the 
elder.&nbsp; &ldquo;For I think she smiled upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the younger plucked his father by the sleeve.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a word in your ear.&nbsp; 
If I find favour in your sight, might not I wed this maid, for I 
think she smiles upon me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A word in yours,&rdquo; said the King his father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Waiting is good hunting, and when the teeth are shut the 
tongue is at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now they were come into the dun, and feasted; and this was a 
great house, so that the lads were astonished; and the King that 
was a priest sat at the end of the board and was silent, so that 
the lads were filled with reverence; and the maid served them 
smiling with downcast eyes, so that their hearts were 
enlarged.</p>
<p>Before it was day, the elder son arose, and he found the maid 
at her weaving, for she was a diligent girl.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Maid,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;I would fain marry 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must speak with my father,&rdquo; said she, and she
looked upon the ground smiling, and became like the rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her heart is with me,&rdquo; said the elder son, and he
went down to the lake and sang.</p>
<p>A little after came the younger son.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maid,&rdquo;
quoth he, &ldquo;if our fathers were agreed, I would like well to
marry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can speak to my father,&rdquo; said she; and looked
upon the ground, and smiled and grew like the rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a dutiful daughter,&rdquo; said the younger son,
&ldquo;she will make an obedient wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he 
thought, &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; and he remembered the 
King her father was a priest; so he went into the temple, and 
sacrificed a weasel and a hare.</p>
<p>Presently the news got about; and the two lads and the first 
King were called into the presence of the King who was a priest, 
where he sat upon the high seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little I reck of gear,&rdquo; said the King who was a 
priest, &ldquo;and little of power.&nbsp; For we live here among 
the shadow of things, and the heart is sick of seeing them.&nbsp;
And we stay here in the wind like raiment drying, and the heart 
is weary of the wind.&nbsp; But one thing I love, and that is 
truth; and for one thing will I give my daughter, and that is the
trial stone.&nbsp; For in the light of that stone the seeming 
goes, and the being shows, and all things besides are 
worthless.&nbsp; Therefore, lads, if ye would wed my daughter, 
out foot, and bring me the stone of touch, for that is the price 
of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A word in your ear,&rdquo; said the younger son to his 
father.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think we do very well without this 
stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A word in yours,&rdquo; said the father.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am of your way of thinking; but when the teeth are shut the 
tongue is at home.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he smiled to the King that 
was a priest.</p>
<p>But the elder son got to his feet, and called the King that 
was a priest by the name of father.&nbsp; &ldquo;For whether I 
marry the maid or no, I will call you by that word for the love 
of your wisdom; and even now I will ride forth and search the 
world for the stone of touch.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he said farewell, 
and rode into the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I will go, too,&rdquo; said the younger son, 
&ldquo;if I can have your leave.&nbsp; For my heart goes out to 
the maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will ride home with me,&rdquo; said his father.</p>
<p>So they rode home, and when they came to the dun, the King had
his son into his treasury.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;is the touchstone which shows truth; for there is no truth
but plain truth; and if you will look in this, you will see 
yourself as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the younger son looked in it, and saw his face as it were 
the face of a beardless youth, and he was well enough pleased; 
for the thing was a piece of a mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is no such great thing to make a work 
about,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but if it will get me the maid I 
shall never complain.&nbsp; But what a fool is my brother to ride
into the world, and the thing all the while at home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they rode back to the other dun, and showed the mirror to 
the King that was a priest; and when he had looked in it, and 
seen himself like a King, and his house like a King&rsquo;s 
house, and all things like themselves, he cried out and blessed 
God.&nbsp; &ldquo;For now I know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is
no truth but the plain truth; and I am a King indeed, although my
heart misgave me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he pulled down his temple, and
built a new one; and then the younger son was married to the 
maid.</p>
<p>In the meantime the elder son rode into the world to find the 
touchstone of the trial of truth; and whenever he came to a place
of habitation, he would ask the men if they had heard of 
it.&nbsp; And in every place the men answered: &ldquo;Not only 
have we heard of it, but we alone, of all men, possess the thing 
itself, and it hangs in the side of our chimney to this 
day&rdquo;.&nbsp; Then would the elder son be glad, and beg for a
sight of it.&nbsp; And sometimes it would be a piece of mirror, 
that showed the seeming of things; and then he would say, 
&ldquo;This can never be, for there should be more than 
seeming&rdquo;.&nbsp; And sometimes it would be a lump of coal, 
which showed nothing; and then he would say, &ldquo;This can 
never be, for at least there is the seeming&rdquo;.&nbsp; And 
sometimes it would be a touchstone indeed, beautiful in hue, 
adorned with polishing, the light inhabiting its sides; and when 
he found this, he would beg the thing, and the persons of that 
place would give it him, for all men were very generous of that 
gift; so that at the last he had his wallet full of them, and 
they chinked together when he rode; and when he halted by the 
side of the way he would take them out and try them, till his 
head turned like the sails upon a windmill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A murrain upon this business!&rdquo; said the elder 
son, &ldquo;for I perceive no end to it.&nbsp; Here I have the 
red, and here the blue and the green; and to me they seem all 
excellent, and yet shame each other.&nbsp; A murrain on the 
trade!&nbsp; If it were not for the King that is a priest and 
whom I have called my father, and if it were not for the fair 
maid of the dun that makes my mouth to sing and my heart enlarge,
I would even tumble them all into the salt sea, and go home and 
be a King like other folk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he was like the hunter that has seen a stag upon a 
mountain, so that the night may fall, and the fire be kindled, 
and the lights shine in his house; but desire of that stag is 
single in his bosom.</p>
<p>Now after many years the elder son came upon the sides of the 
salt sea; and it was night, and a savage place, and the clamour 
of the sea was loud.&nbsp; There he was aware of a house, and a 
man that sat there by the light of a candle, for he had no 
fire.&nbsp; Now the elder son came in to him, and the man gave 
him water to drink, for he had no bread; and wagged his head when
he was spoken to, for he had no words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you the touchstone of truth?&rdquo; asked the 
elder son and when the man had wagged his head, &ldquo;I might 
have known that,&rdquo; cried the elder son.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have 
here a wallet full of them!&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that he 
laughed, although his heart was weary.</p>
<p>And with that the man laughed too, and with the fuff of his 
laughter the candle went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;for now I think you 
have come far enough; and your quest is ended, and my candle is 
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now when the morning came, the man gave him a clear pebble in 
his hand, and it had no beauty and no colour; and the elder son 
looked upon it scornfully and shook his head; and he went away, 
for it seemed a small affair to him.</p>
<p>All that day he rode, and his mind was quiet, and the desire 
of the chase allayed.&nbsp; &ldquo;How if this poor pebble be the
touchstone, after all?&rdquo; said he: and he got down from his 
horse, and emptied forth his wallet by the side of the way.&nbsp;
Now, in the light of each other, all the touchstones lost their 
hue and fire, and withered like stars at morning; but in the 
light of the pebble, their beauty remained, only the pebble was 
the most bright.&nbsp; And the elder son smote upon his 
brow.&nbsp; &ldquo;How if this be the truth?&rdquo; he cried, 
&ldquo;that all are a little true?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he took the 
pebble, and turned its light upon the heavens, and they deepened 
about him like the pit; and he turned it on the hills, and the 
hills were cold and rugged, but life ran in their sides so that 
his own life bounded; and he turned it on the dust, and he beheld
the dust with joy and terror; and he turned it on himself, and 
kneeled down and prayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, thanks be to God,&rdquo; said the elder son, 
&ldquo;I have found the touchstone; and now I may turn my reins, 
and ride home to the King and to the maid of the dun that makes 
my mouth to sing and my heart enlarge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now when he came to the dun, he saw children playing by the 
gate where the King had met him in the old days; and this stayed 
his pleasure, for he thought in his heart, &ldquo;It is here my 
children should be playing&rdquo;.&nbsp; And when he came into 
the hall, there was his brother on the high seat and the maid 
beside him; and at that his anger rose, for he thought in his 
heart, &ldquo;It is I that should be sitting there, and the maid 
beside me&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said his brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;And 
what make you in the dun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your elder brother,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;And I am come to marry the maid, for I have brought the 
touchstone of truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the younger brother laughed aloud.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I found the touchstone years 
ago, and married the maid, and there are our children playing at 
the gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now at this the elder brother grew as gray as the dawn.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I pray you have dealt justly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for I
perceive my life is lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justly?&rdquo; quoth the younger brother.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It becomes you ill, that are a restless man and a 
runagate, to doubt my justice, or the King my father&rsquo;s, 
that are sedentary folk and known in the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the elder brother, &ldquo;you have all
else, have patience also; and suffer me to say the world is full 
of touchstones, and it appears not easily which is 
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no shame of mine,&rdquo; said the younger 
brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;There it is, and look in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the elder brother looked in the mirror, and he was sore 
amazed; for he was an old man, and his hair was white upon his 
head; and he sat down in the hall and wept aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the younger brother, &ldquo;see what a
fool&rsquo;s part you have played, that ran over all the world to
seek what was lying in our father&rsquo;s treasury, and came back
an old carle for the dogs to bark at, and without chick or 
child.&nbsp; And I that was dutiful and wise sit here crowned 
with virtues and pleasures, and happy in the light of my 
hearth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methinks you have a cruel tongue,&rdquo; said the elder
brother; and he pulled out the clear pebble and turned its light 
on his brother; and behold the man was lying, his soul was shrunk
into the smallness of a pea, and his heart was a bag of little 
fears like scorpions, and love was dead in his bosom.&nbsp; And 
at that the elder brother cried out aloud, and turned the light 
of the pebble on the maid, and, lo! she was but a mask of a 
woman, and withinside&rsquo;s she was quite dead, and she smiled 
as a clock ticks, and knew not wherefore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said the elder brother, &ldquo;I 
perceive there is both good and bad.&nbsp; So fare ye all as well
as ye may in the dun; but I will go forth into the world with my 
pebble in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>XIX.&mdash;THE POOR THING.</h2>
<p>There was a man in the islands who fished for his bare 
bellyful, and took his life in his hands to go forth upon the sea
between four planks.&nbsp; But though he had much ado, he was 
merry of heart; and the gulls heard him laugh when the spray met 
him.&nbsp; And though he had little lore, he was sound of spirit;
and when the fish came to his hook in the mid-waters, he blessed 
God without weighing.&nbsp; He was bitter poor in goods and 
bitter ugly of countenance, and he had no wife.</p>
<p>It fell in the time of the fishing that the man awoke in his 
house about the midst of the afternoon.&nbsp; The fire burned in 
the midst, and the smoke went up and the sun came down by the 
chimney.&nbsp; And the man was aware of the likeness of one that 
warmed his hands at the red peats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I greet you,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;in the name of
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I greet you,&rdquo; said he that warmed his hands, 
&ldquo;but not in the name of God, for I am none of His; nor in 
the name of Hell, for I am not of Hell.&nbsp; For I am but a 
bloodless thing, less than wind and lighter than a sound, and the
wind goes through me like a net, and I am broken by a sound and 
shaken by the cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be plain with me,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;and tell 
me your name and of your nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; quoth the other, &ldquo;is not yet 
named, and my nature not yet sure.&nbsp; For I am part of a man; 
and I was a part of your fathers, and went out to fish and fight 
with them in the ancient days.&nbsp; But now is my turn not yet 
come; and I wait until you have a wife, and then shall I be in 
your son, and a brave part of him, rejoicing manfully to launch 
the boat into the surf, skilful to direct the helm, and a man of 
might where the ring closes and the blows are going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a marvellous thing to hear,&rdquo; said the 
man; &ldquo;and if you are indeed to be my son, I fear it will go
ill with you; for I am bitter poor in goods and bitter ugly in 
face, and I shall never get me a wife if I live to the age of 
eagles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this hate I come to remedy, my Father,&rdquo; said 
the Poor Thing; &ldquo;for we must go this night to the little 
isle of sheep, where our fathers lie in the dead-cairn, and 
to-morrow to the Earl&rsquo;s Hall, and there shall you find a 
wife by my providing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the man rose and put forth his boat at the time of the 
sunsetting; and the Poor Thing sat in the prow, and the spray 
blew through his bones like snow, and the wind whistled in his 
teeth, and the boat dipped not with the weight of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am fearful to see you, my son,&rdquo; said the 
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;For methinks you are no thing of 
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only the wind that whistles in my teeth,&rdquo; 
said the Poor Thing, &ldquo;and there is no life in me to keep it
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they came to the little isle of sheep, where the surf burst
all about it in the midst of the sea, and it was all green with 
bracken, and all wet with dew, and the moon enlightened it.&nbsp;
They ran the boat into a cove, and set foot to land; and the man 
came heavily behind among the rocks in the deepness of the 
bracken, but the Poor Thing went before him like a smoke in the 
light of the moon.&nbsp; So they came to the dead-cairn, and they
laid their ears to the stones; and the dead complained 
withinsides like a swarm of bees: &ldquo;Time was that marrow was
in our bones, and strength in our sinews; and the thoughts of our
head were clothed upon with acts and the words of men.&nbsp; But 
now are we broken in sunder, and the bonds of our bones are 
loosed, and our thoughts lie in the dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then said the Poor Thing: &ldquo;Charge them that they give 
you the virtue they withheld&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And the man said: &ldquo;Bones of my fathers, greeting! for I 
am sprung of your loins.&nbsp; And now, behold, I break open the 
piled stones of your cairn, and I let in the noon between your 
ribs.&nbsp; Count it well done, for it was to be; and give me 
what I come seeking in the name of blood and in the name of 
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the spirits of the dead stirred in the cairn like ants; 
and they spoke: &ldquo;You have broken the roof of our cairn and 
let in the noon between our ribs; and you have the strength of 
the still-living.&nbsp; But what virtue have we? what power? or 
what jewel here in the dust with us, that any living man should 
covet or receive it? for we are less than nothing.&nbsp; But we 
tell you one thing, speaking with many voices like bees, that the
way is plain before all like the grooves of launching: So forth 
into life and fear not, for so did we all in the ancient 
ages.&rdquo;&nbsp; And their voices passed away like an eddy in a
river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Poor Thing, &ldquo;they have told 
you a lesson, but make them give you a gift.&nbsp; Stoop your 
hand among the bones without drawback, and you shall find their 
treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the man stooped his hand, and the dead laid hold upon it 
many and faint like ants; but he shook them off, and behold, what
he brought up in his hand was the shoe of a horse, and it was 
rusty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a thing of no price,&rdquo; quoth the man, 
&ldquo;for it is rusty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see that,&rdquo; said the Poor Thing; 
&ldquo;for in my thought it is a good thing to do what our 
fathers did, and to keep what they kept without question.&nbsp; 
And in my thought one thing is as good as another in this world; 
and a shoe of a horse will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now they got into their boat with the horseshoe, and when the 
dawn was come they were aware of the smoke of the Earl&rsquo;s 
town and the bells of the Kirk that beat.&nbsp; So they set foot 
to shore; and the man went up to the market among the fishers 
over against the palace and the Kirk; and he was bitter poor and 
bitter ugly, and he had never a fish to sell, but only a shoe of 
a horse in his creel, and it rusty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Poor Thing, &ldquo;do so and so, 
and you shall find a wife and I a mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It befell that the Earl&rsquo;s daughter came forth to go into
the Kirk upon her prayers; and when she saw the poor man stand in
the market with only the shoe of a horse, and it rusty, it came 
in her mind it should be a thing of price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; quoth she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a shoe of a horse,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is the use of it?&rdquo; quoth the 
Earl&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for no use,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may not believe that,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;else 
why should you carry it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do so,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;because it was so my 
fathers did in the ancient ages; and I have neither a better 
reason nor a worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the Earl&rsquo;s daughter could not find it in her mind to
believe him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; quoth she, &ldquo;sell me 
this, for I am sure it is a thing of price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;the thing is not for 
sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the Earl&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Then what make you here in the town&rsquo;s market, with 
the thing in your creel and nought beside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sit here,&rdquo; says the man, &ldquo;to get me a 
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no sense in any of these answers,&rdquo; 
thought the Earl&rsquo;s daughter; &ldquo;and I could find it in 
my heart to weep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By came the Earl upon that; and she called him and told him 
all.&nbsp; And when he had heard, he was of his daughter&rsquo;s 
mind that this should be a thing of virtue; and charged the man 
to set a price upon the thing, or else be hanged upon the 
gallows; and that was near at hand, so that the man could see 
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way of life is straight like the grooves of 
launching,&rdquo; quoth the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if I am to be 
hanged let me be hanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; cried the Earl, &ldquo;will you set your 
neck against a shoe of a horse, and it rusty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my thought,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;one thing is
as good as another in this world and a shoe of a horse will 
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This can never be,&rdquo; thought the Earl; and he 
stood and looked upon the man, and bit his beard.</p>
<p>And the man looked up at him and smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was 
so my fathers did in the ancient ages,&rdquo; quoth he to the 
Earl, &ldquo;and I have neither a better reason nor a 
worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no sense in any of this,&rdquo; thought the 
Earl, &ldquo;and I must be growing old.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he had 
his daughter on one side, and says he: &ldquo;Many suitors have 
you denied, my child.&nbsp; But here is a very strange matter 
that a man should cling so to a shoe of a horse, and it rusty; 
and that he should offer it like a thing on sale, and yet not 
sell it; and that he should sit there seeking a wife.&nbsp; If I 
come not to the bottom of this thing, I shall have no more 
pleasure in bread; and I can see no way, but either I should hang
or you should marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my troth, but he is bitter ugly,&rdquo; said the 
Earl&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;How if the gallows be so near
at hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not so,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;that my 
fathers did in the ancient ages.&nbsp; I am like the man, and can
give you neither a better reason nor a worse.&nbsp; But do you, 
prithee, speak with him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Earl&rsquo;s daughter spoke to the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
you were not so bitter ugly,&rdquo; quoth she, &ldquo;my father 
the Earl would have us marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bitter ugly am I,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;and you 
as fair as May.&nbsp; Bitter ugly I am, and what of that?&nbsp; 
It was so my fathers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of God,&rdquo; said the Earl&rsquo;s 
daughter, &ldquo;let your fathers be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had done that,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;you had
never been chaffering with me here in the market, nor your father
the Earl watching with the end of his eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But come,&rdquo; quoth the Earl&rsquo;s daughter, 
&ldquo;this is a very strange thing, that you would have me wed 
for a shoe of a horse, and it rusty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my thought,&rdquo; quoth the man, &ldquo;one thing 
is as good&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, spare me that,&rdquo; said the Earl&rsquo;s 
daughter, &ldquo;and tell me why I should marry.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen and look,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>Now the wind blew through the Poor Thing like an infant 
crying, so that her heart was melted; and her eyes were unsealed,
and she was aware of the thing as it were a babe unmothered, and 
she took it to her arms, and it melted in her arms like the 
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;behold a vision of 
our children, the busy hearth, and the white heads.&nbsp; And let
that suffice, for it is all God offers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no delight in it,&rdquo; said she; but with that
she sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ways of life are straight like the grooves of 
launching,&rdquo; said the man; and he took her by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what shall we do with the horseshoe?&rdquo; quoth 
she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give it to your father,&rdquo; said the man; 
&ldquo;and he can make a kirk and a mill of it for me.&rdquo;<br 
/>
</p>
<p>It came to pass in time that the Poor Thing was born; but 
memory of these matters slept within him, and he knew not that 
which he had done.&nbsp; But he was a part of the eldest son; 
rejoicing manfully to launch the boat into the surf, skilful to 
direct the helm, and a man of might where the ring closes and the
blows are going.</p>
<h2>XX.&mdash;THE SONG OF THE MORROW.</h2>
<p>The King of Duntrine had a daughter when he was old, and she 
was the fairest King&rsquo;s daughter between two seas; her hair 
was like spun gold, and her eyes like pools in a river; and the 
King gave her a castle upon the sea beach, with a terrace, and a 
court of the hewn stone, and four towers at the four 
corners.&nbsp; Here she dwelt and grew up, and had no care for 
the morrow, and no power upon the hour, after the manner of 
simple men.</p>
<p>It befell that she walked one day by the beach of the sea, 
when it was autumn, and the wind blew from the place of rains; 
and upon the one hand of her the sea beat, and upon the other the
dead leaves ran.&nbsp; This was the loneliest beach between two 
seas, and strange things had been done there in the ancient 
ages.&nbsp; Now the King&rsquo;s daughter was aware of a crone 
that sat upon the beach.&nbsp; The sea foam ran to her feet, and 
the dead leaves swarmed about her back, and the rags blew about 
her face in the blowing of the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the King&rsquo;s daughter, and she 
named a holy name, &ldquo;this is the most unhappy old crone 
between two seas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daughter of a King,&rdquo; said the crone, &ldquo;you 
dwell in a stone house, and your hair is like the gold: but what 
is your profit?&nbsp; Life is not long, nor lives strong; and you
live after the way of simple men, and have no thought for the 
morrow and no power upon the hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought for the morrow, that I have,&rdquo; said the 
King&rsquo;s daughter; &ldquo;but power upon the hour, that have 
I not.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she mused with herself.</p>
<p>Then the crone smote her lean hands one within the other, and 
laughed like a sea-gull.&nbsp; &ldquo;Home!&rdquo; cried 
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;O daughter of a King, home to your stone house;
for the longing is come upon you now, nor can you live any more 
after the manner of simple men.&nbsp; Home, and toil and suffer, 
till the gift come that will make you bare, and till the man come
that will bring you care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s daughter made no more ado, but she turned 
about and went home to her house in silence.&nbsp; And when she 
was come into her chamber she called for her nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nurse,&rdquo; said the King&rsquo;s daughter, 
&ldquo;thought is come upon me for the morrow, so that I can live
no more after the manner of simple men.&nbsp; Tell me what I must
do that I may have power upon the hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the nurse moaned like a snow wind.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that this thing should be; 
but the thought is gone into your marrow, nor is there any cure 
against the thought.&nbsp; Be it so, then, even as you will; 
though power is less than weakness, power shall you have; and 
though the thought is colder than winter, yet shall you think it 
to an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the King&rsquo;s daughter sat in her vaulted chamber in the
masoned house, and she thought upon the thought.&nbsp; Nine years
she sat; and the sea beat upon the terrace, and the gulls cried 
about the turrets, and wind crooned in the chimneys of the 
house.&nbsp; Nine years she came not abroad, nor tasted the clean
air, neither saw God&rsquo;s sky.&nbsp; Nine years she sat and 
looked neither to the right nor to the left, nor heard speech of 
any one, but thought upon the thought of the morrow.&nbsp; And 
her nurse fed her in silence, and she took of the food with her 
left hand, and ate it without grace.</p>
<p>Now when the nine years were out, it fell dusk in the autumn, 
and there came a sound in the wind like a sound of piping.&nbsp; 
At that the nurse lifted up her finger in the vaulted house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear a sound in the wind,&rdquo; said she, 
&ldquo;that is like the sound of piping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is but a little sound,&rdquo; said the King&rsquo;s 
daughter, &ldquo;but yet is it sound enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went down in the dusk to the doors of the house, and 
along the beach of the sea.&nbsp; And the waves beat upon the one
hand, and upon the other the dead leaves ran; and the clouds 
raced in the sky, and the gulls flew widdershins.&nbsp; And when 
they came to that part of the beach where strange things had been
done in the ancient ages, lo, there was the crone, and she was 
dancing widdershins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you dance widdershins, old crone?&rdquo; 
said the King&rsquo;s daughter; &ldquo;here upon the bleak beach,
between the waves and the dead leaves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear a sound in the wind that is like a sound of 
piping,&rdquo; quoth she.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it is for that that I 
dance widdershins.&nbsp; For the gift comes that will make you 
bare, and the man comes that must bring you care.&nbsp; But for 
me the morrow is come that I have thought upon, and the hour of 
my power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How comes it, crone,&rdquo; said the King&rsquo;s 
daughter, &ldquo;that you waver like a rag, and pale like a dead 
leaf before my eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the morrow has come that I have thought upon, 
and the hour of my power,&rdquo; said the crone; and she fell on 
the beach, and, lo! she was but stalks of the sea tangle, and 
dust of the sea sand, and the sand lice hopped upon the place of 
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the strangest thing that befell between two 
seas,&rdquo; said the King&rsquo;s daughter of Duntrine.</p>
<p>But the nurse broke out and moaned like an autumn gale.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I am weary of the wind,&rdquo; quoth she; and she bewailed
her day.</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s daughter was aware of a man upon the beach; 
he went hooded so that none might perceive his face, and a pipe 
was underneath his arm.&nbsp; The sound of his pipe was like 
singing wasps, and like the wind that sings in windlestraw; and 
it took hold upon men&rsquo;s ears like the crying of gulls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the comer?&rdquo; quoth the King&rsquo;s 
daughter of Duntrine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the corner,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and these are 
the pipes that a man may hear, and I have power upon the hour, 
and this is the song of the morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he piped the
song of the morrow, and it was as long as years; and the nurse 
wept out aloud at the hearing of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is true,&rdquo; said the King&rsquo;s daughter, 
&ldquo;that you pipe the song of the morrow; but that ye have 
power upon the hour, how may I know that?&nbsp; Show me a marvel 
here upon the beach, between the waves and the dead 
leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man said, &ldquo;Upon whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is my nurse,&rdquo; quoth the King&rsquo;s 
daughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is weary of the wind.&nbsp; Show me a 
good marvel upon her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, lo! the nurse fell upon the beach as it were two handfuls
of dead leaves, and the wind whirled them widdershins, and the 
sand lice hopped between.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said the King&rsquo;s daughter of 
Duntrine, &ldquo;you are the comer, and you have power upon the 
hour.&nbsp; Come with me to my stone house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went by the sea margin, and the man piped the song of 
the morrow, and the leaves followed behind them as they went.</p>
<p>Then they sat down together; and the sea beat on the terrace, 
and the gulls cried about the towers, and the wind crooned in the
chimneys of the house.&nbsp; Nine years they sat, and every year 
when it fell autumn, the man said, &ldquo;This is the hour, and I
have power in it&rdquo;; and the daughter of the King said, 
&ldquo;Nay, but pipe me the song of the morrow&rdquo;.&nbsp; And 
he piped it, and it was long like years.</p>
<p>Now when the nine years were gone, the King&rsquo;s daughter 
of Duntrine got her to her feet, like one that remembers; and she
looked about her in the masoned house; and all her servants were 
gone; only the man that piped sat upon the terrace with the hand 
upon his face; and as he piped the leaves ran about the terrace 
and the sea beat along the wall.&nbsp; Then she cried to him with
a great voice, &ldquo;This is the hour, and let me see the power 
in it&rdquo;.&nbsp; And with that the wind blew off the hood from
the man&rsquo;s face, and, lo! there was no man there, only the 
clothes and the hood and the pipes tumbled one upon another in a 
corner of the terrace, and the dead leaves ran over them.</p>
<p>And the King&rsquo;s daughter of Duntrine got her to that part
of the beach where strange things had been done in the ancient 
ages; and there she sat her down.&nbsp; The sea foam ran to her 
feet, and the dead leaves swarmed about her back, and the veil 
blew about her face in the blowing of the wind.&nbsp; And when 
she lifted up her eyes, there was the daughter of a King come 
walking on the beach.&nbsp; Her hair was like the spun gold, and 
her eyes like pools in a river, and she had no thought for the 
morrow and no power upon the hour, after the manner of simple 
men.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
